We launched Divine Absolute salon in 2012, which offers bespoke services defining the ultimate facets of hair and beauty. The state-of-the-art salon is currently present in the 3 cities- Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai. In 2015, Divine Lever formalised a strategic alliance with Aptech â€“ a global leader in vocational training to set up 80 Divine beauty academies to train 50,000 stylists across India, over five years. Divine Academy powered by Aptech, offers both foundation and advanced level training in skin, hair and make-up.
